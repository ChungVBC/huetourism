    <p>Built in 1601 on the order of the first Nguyen lords, Nguyen Hoang, who at that time was the governor of Thuan Hoa (now known as Hue). The Nguyen Lords were in name, officials of the ruling LÃª Dynasty in Hanoi, but was the de facto independent ruler of central Vietnam. According to the royal annals, Hoang while touring the vicinity, was told of the local legend in which an old lady, known as Thien Mu (literally celestial lady), dressed in red and blue sat at the site, rubbing her cheeks. She foretold that a lord would come and erect a pagoda on the hill to pray for the country's prosperity. She then vanished after making her prophecy. Upon hearing this, Hoang ordered the construction of a temple at the site, thus the beginning of Thien Mu Tu.</p>
