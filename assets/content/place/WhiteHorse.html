    <p>Bạch Mã National Park is situated in the Annamite Mountains and is one of the wettest places in Vietnam. Its mountains are composed mainly of granite, and the topography of the park is generally very steep.
Bạch Mã's position, at the biogeographical border between northern and southern Vietnam, combined with its variety of habitats, ranging from the coast to high mountains, means the park is rich in biodiversity. It is located in an area that is considered a 'Centre of Plant Diversity' in Vietnam. The main vegetation type is moist evergreen forest and montane forest, as well as areas of scrub and grassland where human disturbance has been high.
The mammal fauna of the park is not well known, though historically it held important species such as Asian elephant, White-cheeked Gibbons and Red-shanked Douc langurs. It also protects important bird species, ezpecially Vietnamese endemics such as the Crested Argus, the Annam Partridge, as well as the previously considered extinct Edwards's Pheasant.</p>
